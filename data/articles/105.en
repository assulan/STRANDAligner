<p style="text-align: justify;">On November 13, 2014 the Permanent Representative of the Republic of Kazakhstan to the UN Office and other International Organizations in Geneva, Ambassador Mukhtar Tileuberdi had a meeting with the recently elected UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Prince Zeid Ra'ad Zeid Al-Hussein.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The High Commissioner informed that he is familiar about the Address by the President Nursultan Nazarbayev to the people of Kazakhstan "Nurly Zhol – Path to the Future". In his opinion, the Address inspires confidence in the future. He also noted that the idea of the President Nazarbayev on importance of preserving interethnic harmony and stability in society is universal and can be applied in other countries. Prince Al-Hussein stressed that the current generation of Kazakhstan people has indeed grown in the unique society without wars and conflicts.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Kazakhstan diplomat extended his congratulations to Prince Al-Hussein on his election to such a high position and noted the fruitful background of the mutual relationships between Kazakhstan and the Office of the High Commissioner. Mukhtar Tileuberdi acquainted the interlocutor with the policies and programs of the Government of Kazakhstan in the field of protection of human rights and freedom snoting the changes in the recent years as well. He stressed that in the Address to the Nation "Nurly Zhol–Path to future" the President Nursultan Nazarbayev has put forward the creation of one of the most safe and comfortable country to live in as one of the development priorities.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Republic of Kazakhstan has successfully defended the second National Report on the implementation of international obligations in the field of promotion and protection of fundamental human rights and freedoms on October 30, 2014. As the outcome of the interactive dialogue with the members and observers of the UN Human Rights Council Kazakhstan received a total of 194 recommendations. The Permanent Representative of Kazakhstan drew attention of the High Commissioner to constructive cooperation with the UN human rights mechanisms, including the Special Procedures of the Human Rights Council. Since forwarding of the open invitation in 2009 our country was visited by eight UN Special Rapporteurs. Three more visits of the special mandate holders are plannedin 2015. Kazakhstan provides national reports to the relevant UN Committees on a regular basis. Thus, the defense of the third Periodic Report on the implementation of Kazakhstan of the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment will take place on November 17-18, 2014.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Permanent Representative of Kazakhstan handed the invitation to the High Commissioner to pay an official visit to Kazakhstan.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In his turn, Prince Al-Hussein congratulated on the successful completion of the 2nd cycle of the Universal Periodic Review and highly appraised the achievements of our country in the field of protection of human rights and freedoms. As noted by the High Commissioner, the successful completion by Kazakhstan of this review cycle suggests fruitful cooperation of the Government of Kazakhstan with human rights mechanisms, civil institutions and international organizations. In this context Prince Zeid Al-Hussein expressed readiness for further interaction including through participation in the preparation of the Action Plan for implementation of the recommendations of the 2nd cycle of the Universal Periodic Review for 2015-2020.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The High Commissioner gratefully accepted an invitation to visit Kazakhstan and wished a successful campaign for the elections to the non-permanent member of the UN Security Council for 2017-2018.</p>
